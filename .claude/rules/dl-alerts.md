# `pending_alerts` durable alert outbox — retention + routing gotchas

The `pending_alerts` outbox (`dl_alerts.py`, #239) durably records DL processing-health
alerts before any Odoo delivery, retries grouped delivery on the ~15s worker tick, and
bounds its own growth. Two reusable lessons from #319 (held channel-0 retention):

## Adding retention/expiry for a NEW row-state — mirror `prune_delivered`, and fix the
## module-top docstring in the SAME change

There are now TWO bounded-retention states: DELIVERED rows (`prune_delivered()`,
`DELIVERED_RETENTION_DAYS`) and HELD channel-0 undelivered rows (`purge_held()`,
`HELD_RETENTION_DAYS`, #319). A future third retention class copies the SAME shape:

- constant + a function `def purge_x(conn, older_than_days=<CONST>) -> int:` with the same
  `max(1, int(older_than_days))` guard + `... RETURNING id` + `return len(rows)`;
- wire it into the SAME `worker.run_forever` maintenance tick right after
  `prune_delivered(conn)` (inside the existing `try/except`, no new timer/path);
- **narrow the WHERE precisely.** `purge_held` deletes ONLY `channel_id = 0 AND
  delivered_at IS NULL AND created_at < now() - window`. An undelivered row with a REAL
  channel (a genuine Odoo delivery failure) must NEVER be purged — that is the exact
  silent-loss this outbox exists to prevent. A "delete every old undelivered row" sweep
  is WRONG; only channel-0 rows (no delivery target) are safe to expire.
- **update the module-top docstring narrative in the SAME diff.** A review 🔴/🔵 caught
  the "finding 4 — unbounded growth" paragraph still calling delivered rows "the ONE
  state" with retention after a second state was added. The authoritative per-function
  docstring is not enough — the opening narrative a reader scans first must stay accurate.

## A value FROZEN at enqueue time that should later resolve to CURRENT config must be
## RE-DERIVED at flush, never read frozen off the row

`enqueue()` stores `channel_id = 0` when no ops channel is configured yet (#310). The old
`flush_pending()` read that frozen `0` off the row and skipped the group forever — so once
`ops_channel_id` WAS configured later, already-held rows never reached it. Fix:
`target = channel_id or report.ops_channel(cfg)` — re-derive the current ops channel per
channel-0 group at flush time; `if not target: continue` keeps it held while still unset
(never passes 0 downstream → no #310 misroute to the sales channel 152). Same class as
`orders-corpus.md`'s #229 note (an already-persisted `0` retroactively resolves via the
`or N` idiom): any enqueued/persisted "not configured yet" sentinel that a later config
should satisfy must be recomputed against live config at consume time, not trusted frozen.

## Testing

`test_dl_alerts.py` uses the `pg` fixture (TRUNCATEs `pending_alerts` per test).
`purge_held` retention is proven with a 4-row fixture differing on each discriminating
column (age / channel / delivered) asserting the exact survivor set — a wrong predicate on
any one condition fails it. The re-route is proven by asserting held-then-delivered across
two `flush_pending` calls with `cfg.ops_channel_id` unset then set.
